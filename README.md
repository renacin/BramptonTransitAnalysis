# Transit GTFS Data Project: Collection & Analysis

## Introduction:
This project is ever growing, and expanding as time goes on.

Originally, I wanted this project to be a test of my data acquisition, and storage skills.
Can I parse data from a website, and store it effectively in some sort of data base? Turns out I can.
Developing a sort-of-live database was fun, and quite cool to see it grow in size every day.

Having all of that data, it was inevitable that I would want to analyze it.
And so this project then turned into a data analytics attempt. Can I discern patterns from the data that I collected?

The patterns I identified were quite simple. A histogram, line graph, and a few maps later I knew I could do accomplish my goal.

Time went on, and I kept coming back to this project. The more I poked at it, the more I wanted to try again, but with all that I've learned.
And so here we are. This is my 4th attempt at this project?


## Observations And Questions
* [12-29-2023] - Can I interpret traffic patterns from transit GTFS data?


## Procedure:
* [12-29-2023] - For All Routes In A Given Transit System, Determine Which Stops A Bus Visits
* [00-00-0000] - Create A System That Can Effectively Parse, And Store GTFS Data Into A Database
* [00-00-0000] - For A Given Period Of Time, Run System - Gather GTFS Data On A Headless Computer. Build In Contingencies!
* [00-00-0000] - Having Collected Data, Can I Interpret Traffic Patterns From GTFS Data Collected?
